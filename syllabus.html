Requirements </h3>
<section id="books">
<h4>
Readings </h4>
<p>
    This class has no required textbooks and all of your readings will be online. However, I recommend budgeting $60-70 for a couple of reference books for the technologies/tools you concentrate on (javascript, canvas, webgl and so on) this quarter. If you have recommendations beyond what's on the syllabus, bring them in for show &amp; tell.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to these texts, there are readings (and occasionally viewings/listenings) assigned for each week. These are intended to provide historical and aesthetic context and a theoretical vocabulary for understanding artworks viewed in class as well as your own.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recommended
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript: The Good Parts (slightly dated, but still mostly "good")</li>
        <li>Effective JavaScript</li>
        <li>Digital Art (2008 Edition), Christane Paul</li>
        <li>Also see list of online resources on the subreddit</li>

<aside>This is primarily a practice-based class. We will be looking at a variety of work by other artists and occasionally reading relevant texts from a variety of fields that relate to the media we work with, screenings &amp; our discussions via creative projects. We will spend most of our time making things, sharing feedback, ideas and techniques</aside>
<h2>
Grading </h2>
<ul>
    <li>seven assignments: 10% x 7 = 70%</li>
    <li>final project: 20%</li>
    <li>class participation: 10%</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Attendance and Participation </h3>
<p>
    Attendance is mandatory. Three or more absences will result in a grade of YOU SHALL NOT PASS.
</p>
<h3>
Assignments </h3>
<p>
    All assignments must be completed on time. Late submission of completed assignments will receive no credit. We will discuss student work in class. To be fair to those who have submitted their work on time, it will not be possible to give credit for work that is late.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to each assignment, you are required to submit documentation. This can take several forms. In addition to "how this works", you should include some of the following: concepts, theories or other works that your project addresses or references; issues that you had trouble with; tools or ideas you used; tools or ideas you tried but abandoned; what you could have accomplished with a team of highly trained code (or design or whatever) ninjas and an unlimited budget.  Include images/screenshots when appropriate.  Projects that lack documentation will not receive full credit.
</p>
<p>
    All code-based assignments should be linted and beautified before being turned in.
</p>
<h4>General assignment guidelines</h4>
<p>
    Assignment descriptions are intentionally vague. Feel free to interpret things broadly and bounce any ideas you aren't sure of off me.
</p>
<p>
    Plagiarism, appropriation and copyright: Turning in other people's work as your own is obviously off limits, however you may incorporate others' works into your own under the guidelines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">Fair Use</a>. If you do include others' works, cite them in your documentation along with justification for your appropriation
</p>
<p>
    Collaboration on assignments (and the Final Project) is fine, even encouraged. However, each student needs to submit documentation separately.
</p>
<h3>
Final Project </h3>
<p>
    Students are responsible for submitting a final project at the end of the quarter in a digital medium of their choice. In addition to the work itself, documentation of the tools, processes and ideas involved must also be submitted. Projects will be proposed in advance. See subreddit for details.
</p>
<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
<p>
    There are two opportunities for a half-assignment's worth of extra credit.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Subscribe to one of the mailing lists of the W3C, IETF or WHATWG (each organization has several, if not many, lists) that interests you and turn in a report of any of the following (feel free to use archived messages as well). In all cases, make note of the institutions being represented in the discussion:
    <ul>
        <li>A proposed idea: describe the feature, its status within (or not) the relevant spec and describe some of its use cases.</li>
        <li>A point of contention; describe the various positions being taken</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Peer teaching: Present and demostrate a relevant technology, application, library, &amp;c. for the class. Be prepared for Q&amp;A, ~20m or so in total</li>
</ul>
